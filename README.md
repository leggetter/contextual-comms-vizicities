# Contextual Communications on ViziCities

Some very simple sample code used for a talk given at Bristol JS on [Contextual Communications: What, Why and How?](https://www.meetup.com/BristolJS/events/230514129/)

You can view the [Contextual Communication Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/leggetter/contextual-communications-what-why-and-how-bristol-js) on SlideShare.

## Usage

Ensure you've got the [Gulp CLI](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp-cli) installed. Then clone the repo, navigate into the repo directory and run:

```bash
npm install
gulp serve
```

A browser will launch with the example app. The default location is Bristol. Take a look at <index.html>, <lib/main.js> and <lib/vizi.js> for more info. Yeah, it's a bit hacky.

## TODO

Oh so much. The idea was to demonstrate usage of the technologies in the context of a running ViziCities app. So, take a look at [the slides](http://www.slideshare.net/leggetter/contextual-communications-what-why-and-how-bristol-js) and that shows what I'd like examples of within this app.

## Issues

This was done in a bit of a rush. So please do [raise issues](issues/) and I'll get them fixed.
